Fully integrate these features in a highly frictionless, fast, \"always on\", and contextual way. No going around copy pasting information, prompt engineering, or etc. Adapt the UI accordingly.   -Step 4 Initiative. Don't perform a task given a prompt, anticipate the prompt, suggest, initiate.   -Step 5 Delegation hierarchy. Move as much intelligence as you can on device (Apple Silicon very helpful and well-suited), but allow optional dispatch of work to cloud.   -Step 6 Modularity.

Enable text/audio/image/video capability, both read and write. These are the native human APIs, so to speak.   -Step 2 Agentic.

Fully integrate these features in a highly frictionless, fast, \"always on\", and contextual way. No going around copy pasting information, prompt engineering, or etc. Adapt the UI accordingly.   -Step 4 Initiative. Don't perform a task given a prompt, anticipate the prompt, suggest, initiate.   -Step 5 Delegation hierarchy. Move as much intelligence as you can on device (Apple Silicon very helpful and well-suited), but allow optional dispatch of work to cloud.   -Step 6 Modularity. Allow the OS to access and support an entire and growing ecosystem of LLMs (e.g. ChatGPT announcement).   -Step 7 Privacy. &lt;3</p> <p>-We're quickly heading into a world where you can open up your phone and just say stuff.

Given the newness of the platform team, this balance might shift as the environment and products mature, allowing for adjustments based on evolving needs and priorities.</p> <p>Q: What is the role of the AI platform team in shaping organizational culture?</p> <p>A: The platform team fosters a culture of AI innovation and responsibility, encouraging AI fluency and enthusiasm across the organization through training and collaboration.</p> <p>Q: Do AI platform teams lack the domain knowledge of specific products, making them unsuitable substitutes for product-specific engineering teams?</p> <p>A: Yes, AI platform teams lack product-specific knowledge. They're support, not a substitute. To fix this, have the platform team act as a drop-in task force during critical phases, integrating AI while the product squad provides domain expertise. Alternatively, second selected product engineers from a squad to the platform team for a brief period - e.g. six weeks - to share domain knowledge and tailor AI solutions effectively.</p> <p>Q: What kind of support does the platform team offer during the prototyping phase?</p> <p>A: The platform team provides ready-to-use notebooks, components, managed services, and optional low/no-code tools to help non-engineers prototype quickly.</p> <p>Q: How does the platform team facilitate collaboration with third-party AI vendors?</p> <p>A: The platform team vets and integrates third-party AI services, provides documentation, and works with product teams to ensure seamless integration.</p> <p>Q: What happens if product teams don\u2019t cooperate with the platform team, or vice versa?</p> <p>A: The platform team is an optional enabler, offering a range of services as needed. For approved projects with embedded engineers, cooperation is mandatory and ensured through formal agreements endorsed by managers and executives. These agreements include clear requirements, conditions, SLAs, and deliverables, ensuring alignment and accountability, which are critical for achieving company and user outcomes.</p> <p>Q: Will product engineers miss out on learning AI if platform engineers handle the builds, and will knowledge leave with them?</p> <p>A: No. Platform engineers work closely with product teams, provide hands-on training, and keep detailed documentation. Product engineers involved in builds will teach their squad, ensuring everyone learns and retains AI skills.</p> <p>Q: If I don't get approved to work with the platform team, does my AI journey end?</p> <p>A: No. You can still use self-service tools, resources, and training from the platform team. Product teams keep decision-making autonomy and can build AI features on their own. Approved projects get embedded engineers and time-bound support, but this doesn't remove always-available features or limit reapplying for more support.</p>"},{"location":"platform/#metrics-and-success","title":"Metrics and Success","text":"<p>Q: How do we measure the platform team's success?</p> <p>A: We use practical metrics: time-to-market for AI features, the number of successful AI launches, user feedback, and AI feature funnel conversion from ideas to approved projects.

We have a set ratio of resources to projects to manage capacity. This way, the most critical work gets done first.</p> <p>Q: How do we handle the risk of burnout and ensure sustainability if the platform team is constantly working in high-pressure sprints?</p> <p>A: The platform team operates in a high-pressure environment with a clear mission to accelerate AI feature launches. To manage burnout, we maintain a 70-30 split between innovation and BAU tasks, and rotate team members between high-intensity projects and less demanding tasks. We recruit team members with this demanding mission in mind from the outset, ensuring they are prepared for the challenges and committed to delivering high performance.</p>"},{"location":"platform/#continuous-improvement-and-maintenance","title":"Continuous Improvement and Maintenance","text":"<p>Q: In what ways does the platform team accelerate the AI feature development process?</p> <p>A: The platform team speeds up development by providing managed infrastructure, observability tools, design patterns, dedicated support, and task automation.</p> <p>Q: What steps does the platform team take for post-launch support and maintenance of AI features?</p> <p>A: Post-launch, the platform team provides three months of hypercare, automated monitoring, and a BAU service request model to keep AI features running smoothly.</p> <p>Q: What happens if there's a V2 feature idea after launch and hypercare?</p> <p>A: If a V2 feature idea arises post-launch and hypercare, it goes back through the standard stage gates.

Role emulation involves the machine user mimicking or representing a human role, behavior, or persona, often in a digital or virtual environment. Interactivity refers to the machine user's capability to engage in dynamic, two-way interactions, often resembling human-like conversations or social behaviors.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Automated News Reader: Imagine an AI that reads out news articles in a human-like voice. While it might seem like an avatar due to its human-like speech (role emulation), it lacks interactive capabilities. The AI does not engage in two-way communication; it simply performs a one-way broadcast of information. This absence of interactivity classifies it more accurately as a Bot, as it's primarily executing a defined, repetitive task without the dynamic engagement typical of avatars.</p> </li> <li> <p>Virtual Museum Guide: Consider an AI that provides guided tours in a virtual museum. If this AI simply follows a predetermined path and script without engaging with visitors' questions or personalizing the tour based on visitor interactions, it would be an Agent rather than an Avatar. Despite emulating the role of a tour guide (role emulation), the lack of real-time, responsive interaction with visitors means it doesn't fully meet the criteria for an Avatar.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Even when a process utilises advanced technologies like Large Language Models (LLMs), it can still be classified as a Bot. This classification hinges on the task's nature and the level of decision complexity and interactivity, rather than the sophistication of the technology used.</p> <ul> <li>Task Specificity: If the primary role is executing predefined, often repetitive tasks such as data generation or answering standard queries, it aligns with the bot's characteristic functionality.</li> <li> <p>Limited Interactivity: Bots typically exhibit restricted interactive capabilities. A process using LLMs but not engaging in dynamic, responsive dialogues fits this category.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decision Scope: The use of LLMs does not automatically imply complex decision-making. If decisions are based on set rules or parameters, despite the advanced nature of the technology, the process is akin to a bot's operation.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Example: An LLM-driven chatbot for customer service, offering scripted responses to inquiries, demonstrates this concept. Despite its advanced underlying technology, its role in providing specific information without complex interactions or autonomous decision-making categorizes it as a \"Bot.\"</p> <p>In essence, the application and function of the technology, rather than its inherent complexity, determine a machine user's classification.</p>"},{"location":"platform/#education-strategy-edtech_1","title":"Education Strategy / Edtech","text":"<p>Source : https://x.com/zachcohen25/status/1757497529523110191?s=20</p>"},{"location":"platform/#4-key-features","title":"4 key features","text":"<ul> <li>Multimodal ability</li> <li>New interfaces</li> <li>Consumer first, B2B</li> <li>Hyper-specialised products</li> </ul>"},{"location":"platform/#various-companies-in-this-space-to-consider","title":"Various companies in this space to consider","text":"<p>Consumer First General companies worth looking into : https://gamma.app/docs/a16z-Consumer-Abundance-Agenda-ieotbnzbxj81biu?mode=doc</p> Company Description Sizzle AI Multimodal, step by step tutor Curio Toys come to life Magic School AI assistant for educators Iago Learn Japanese while watching anime [Edsoma] (https://www.edsoma.com/) AI reading assistant [Bed Fables] (https://www.bedfables.com/) Create children's stories with AI [Matchbooks AI] (https://matchbooks.ai/) Create children's stories with AI StoryWizard AI Create children's stories with AI Koaluh Create children's stories with AI StoryBird AI Create children's stories with AI Coco Co-create creative projects with kids Pratika Language Learning Lingostar Language Learning Timekettle Translation hardware TalkPal Language learning Elsa Language learning BoldVoice Language Learning Yoodli Language/Communication Learning Fluently Multilingual writing Stimuler Language/Communication learning Cramly Study tutor Studdy Study tutor Foondamate Study tutor Chiron Math education Whiteboard AI Study Aid Gizmo Study Aid Wizdolia Study Aid Caktus Study Aid Kinnu Study Aid Quizlet Study Aid Elicit Research Humata Research Scite Research Genei Research Cerelyze Research Typeset Writing MindGrasp Study Aid Wonders Research Synaptiq Study Aid for Medicine Typeset Science Research Causaly Research Brisk Teaching Teaching Aid ProfJim Teaching Aid Curipod Teaching Aid Class Companion Teaching Aid Pressto Teaching Aid Merlyn Mind Teaching Agents Nolej Teaching Aid Memorang AI platform Quench Turn content into copilot Flintk12 School platform SchoolAI School platform Atypical No idea what this does Kira Contract review Vexis Grading SparkStudio Language Learning Edmachina Retention AI I have a bunch of admissions edtech in Confluence Radius Admissions Extra Edge Marketing and Admissions Enrol ML Admissions Admit Yogi Admissions College Advisor Admissions"},{"location":"platform/#employee-substitute-companies_1","title":"Employee substitute companies","text":"Company Description Cognition Labs Software Engineer Version Lens Product Manager Magic Software Engineer TextQL Data Scientist Fluent Data Analyst Mindy Chief of Staff Ema Universal Employee Finpilot Financial Analyst Rogo Financial Analyst Norm AI Compliance Arini Receptionist Casca Loan Officer Runnr Hotel Concierge Sevn Designer Sierra Customer Support Rasa Customer Support <p>If agents can help product managers architect and orchestrate workflows that result in faster, cheaper and better quality outcomes, then, depending on the scale of the improvement different opportunities open up.</p> <ul> <li>slight improvements lead to more productive PMs</li> <li>large improvements lead to changes in PM skillsets and labour force compositions (the jury is still out) and the move from \"No\" to \"Yes\" (https://x.com/clairevo/status/1774451083622191400?s=20)</li> <li>enormous improvements lead to a reshaping of the technology and productivity landscape with the rise of machine users</li> </ul>"},{"location":"platform/#approach_1","title":"Approach","text":"<ul> <li>Get it working</li> <li>Get it right</li> <li>Get it to scale</li> </ul> <p>https://wiki.c2.com/?MakeItWorkMakeItRightMakeItFast</p>"},{"location":"productivity/","title":"Productivity","text":"<p>Where product managers end up is not where they start.

For instance, neural crest cells and tadpole melanocytes demonstrate that biological entities can exhibit collective behaviors that override individual tendencies, enhancing their adaptive success in their respective environments.</p> <p>In the science fiction novel Kiln People, David Brin introduces the idea of 'dittos'. Dittos are temporary clay replicas that perform tasks, experience the world, and transfer memories back to the original human before expiring at the end of the day. This technology significantly alters social structure, economics, and personal interactions.</p> <p>Dittos are humanoid agents with varying lifespans and intelligence based on colour, representing a gradient from basic labor to advanced cognitive functions. Broadly, the colour abilities are:</p> <ul> <li>Gray: Handle mundane tasks with limited cognitive abilities</li> <li>Green: Engage in skilled labor requiring more intellectual effort</li> <li>Blue: Perform complex problem-solving for specialized professional tasks</li> <li>Black: Tackle highly specialized fields and complex investigations with deep creativity</li> <li>Silver: Used for significant social interactions and business meetings</li> </ul> <p>Each ditto colour addresses a different problem space that is not entirely substitutable or subsumable by another. Silver dittos may be smarter than grays, but it isn't clear that they can do all gray tasks better, faster and cheaper than grays. Further, dittos of the same or different colors working together can often achieve greater outcomes than dittos working alone.</p> <p>Applied to AI agents, these narratives from biology and science fiction suggest two things. First, agents that perform individual tasks or execute entire workflows by interacting with Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are specialised kinds of scaled intelligence. Second, multi-agent collaboration in a task or a workflow is a form of collective intelligence that can lead to better quality decisions and outcomes than monolithic agents can achieve by themselves.</p> <p>Agent Intelligence</p> <p>Agents exhibit scaled and collective intelligence</p> <p>In the simplest interactions, an LMM processing a single request demonstrates momentary agency. This happens when the model uniquely responds to each query, creating something new and appropriate for the situation. These instances illustrate the LLM acting with micro creativity. They underscore the model's capacity to generate outputs that are not strictly predetermined.</p> <p>When LMMs scale from specific tasks towards iterative for-loops - repeating tasks with minor variations - they exhibit rhizomatic agency, inspired by Deleuze and Guattari's concept of endlessly branching structures. Each cycle allows the LLM to subtly adjust its responses, by reading the message history and drawing on the outcomes of previous iterations. This ongoing adaptation distinguishes it from mindless repetition.</p> <p>Moving to more complex scenarios, LMMs in workflows exhibit systemic agency. These systems coordinate multiple processes to handle complex tasks that surpass the abilities of individual components. This coordination enhances decision-making and outcomes.</p> <p>Unlike the transient and adaptive behaviors of momentary and rhizomatic agencies, systemic agency allows workflows to flexibly manage intricate sequences and unexpected challenges, demonstrating a robust capacity for problem-solving.</p> <p>Just as in biology and science fiction, I believe that all LMM interactions from single tasks to complex workflows show signs of agency. By focusing on how this agency scales with the complexity of the problem and solution space, we shift from drawing boundaries between abstract definitions of agents to assessing real-world effectiveness.</p> Caution <p>There are plenty of sensible positions and people differentiating task specific skills and intelligence. However, without discounting their expertise and nuance, I don't find this view to be practical. If an LMM can eventually do many things a human can, and can increasingly provide useful answers to new and unexpected stimuli, why split conceptual hairs over the boundary between skill and intelligence?</p>"},{"location":"productivity/#hypothesis","title":"Hypothesis","text":"<p>My hypothesis is that agentic tasks and pipelines built to accelerate productivity can also be repurposed or adjusted to accelerate creativity; the reverse is also true.</p> <p>The core insight is that creative and productive processes and patterns both rely on overlapping agentic workflows.

One-shot model querying Access the foundation model in a single instance to generate all necessary steps for the plan for cost efficiency and simplicity. Incremental model querying Access the foundation model at each step of the plan generation process to provide supplementary context, improve reasoning certainty and explainability. Single-path plan generator Orchestrate the generation of intermediate steps leading to the achievement of the user\u2019s goal to improve reasoning certainty, coherence and efficiency. Multi-path plan generator Allow multiple choice creation at each intermediate step leading to achieving users\u2019 goals to enhance reasoning certainty, coherence, alignment to human preference and inclusiveness. Self-reflection Enable the agent to generate feedback on the plan and reasoning process and provide refinement guidance from themselves to improve reasoning certainty, explainability, continuous improvement and efficiency. Cross-reflection Use different agents or foundation models to provide feedback and refine the generated plan and reasoning process for better reasoning certainty, explainability, inclusiveness and scalability. Human reflection Collect feedback from humans to refine the plan and reasoning process, to effectively align with human preference, improving contestability and effectiveness. Voting-based cooperation Enable free opinions expression across agents and reach consensus by submitting their votes to preserve fairness, accountability and collective intelligence. Role-based cooperation Assign assorted roles, and finalise decisions in accordance with the roles of agents for to facilitate division of labor, fault tolerance, scalability and accountability. Debate-based cooperation Provide and receive feedback across multiple agents adjusts the thoughts and behaviors during the debate with other agents until a consensus is reached to improve adaptability, explainability and critical thinking. Multimodal guardrails Control the inputs and outputs of foundation models to meet specific requirements such as user requirements, ethical standards, and laws to enhance robustness, safety, standard alignment, and adaptability. Tool/agent registry Maintain a unified and convenient source to select diverse agents and tools to improve discoverability, efficiency, tool appropriateness and scalability.

Known for her living art \u2013 paintings that subtly changed form overnight \u2013 Elara was accused of stealing her own masterpieces from the prestigious Lunar Gallery.</p> <p>The Mystique &amp; Masquerade Detective Agency, with its unique blend of magical insight and detective prowess, took on Elara's case. The agency's founding team, Alexa Vortex, Sam Rivera, and Luna Eclipse, were intrigued by the paradox of an artist accused of stealing her own works.</p> <p>Elara explained how her paintings, imbued with a touch of her shape-shifting essence, were her pride. But over the past month, the original paintings started disappearing, only to be replaced by near-perfect duplicates. The duplicates lacked the subtle magical animation, a signature of Elara's art. This theft not only risked her reputation but also threatened to expose the closely guarded secrets of her shape-shifting community.</p> <p>The agency began its work. Luna, with her fae connections, delved into the supernatural art underworld, seeking whispers of magical art theft. Sam employed his tech skills to analyze the gallery's security footage, looking for digital traces of the thief. Meanwhile, Alexa, with her magical expertise, examined the duplicate paintings for enchantments or magical residues.</p> <p>The breakthrough came from an unexpected quarter. Sam discovered a hidden magical signature in the gallery's security system \u2013 a cloaking spell, expertly masking the thief's identity. Alexa recognized the spell as a rare arcane technique, used by a reclusive sorcerer known for his obsession with magical art.</p> <p>Pooling their resources, the team staged a sting operation during the next exhibit. Elara, using her shape-shifting skills, posed as one of her paintings. As the night grew older, the sorcerer, confident in his magical disguise, appeared to claim his prize. But this time, he was met by the combined forces of Mystique &amp; Masquerade.</p> <p>The sorcerer was apprehended, and Elara's paintings were recovered. The agency not only cleared Elara's name but also helped her understand the depth of her art's impact on both the magical and non-magical communities. Her exhibitions became more popular than ever, celebrated as a fusion of art and life, blurring the lines between reality and enchantment.</p> <p>Thus, the agency solved the mystery, proving that in a world where magic meets the eye, it takes a blend of unique talents to uncover the truth hidden in plain sight.</p>"},{"location":"stories/7/#marketing-jingle","title":"Marketing Jingle","text":"<p>\"Shadows whisper, secrets unfurl, at Mystique &amp; Masquerade, we unravel your world!\"</p>"},{"location":"stories/7/#key-features","title":"Key Features","text":"<ol> <li>Shape-Shifting Reconnaissance: Access to otherwise inaccessible intel.</li> <li>Enchantment-Enhanced Investigations: Magical spells to aid in solving crimes.</li> <li>Tech-Magic Interface: Bridging modern technology with arcane resources.</li> <li>Supernatural Networking: Connections to mystical beings for unique insights.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"stories/7/#haters-corner","title":"Hater's Corner","text":"<p>\"I heard they rely too much on magic.
