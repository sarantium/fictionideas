??? example "Creative AI Experiments"

    Every idea on this site is a **creativity experiment** built entirely with **generative AI**. I explore the **boundaries and techniques of innovation** using increasingly sophisticated **models and pipelines** applied to **fictional worlds**.

    The process I use to create is explained in **[How it Works](howitworks.md)** and the code I use to evaluate quality is explained in **[Evaluation](evaluation.ipynb)**. You can browse the ideas from the sidebar.

    Start with a **[time salad](2.md)**, lie in an **[ocean tent](10.md)** or unfold an **[origami flower](12.md)**. Or maybe you prefer to relax with **[light therapy](18.md)** and grab a **[chilled beverage](19.md)** while watching an **[apocalyptic ride](21.md)** or **[interstellar intrigue](22.md)** unfold.
