??? example "Creative AI Experiments"

    Every idea on this site is a **creativity experiment** built entirely with **generative AI**. I explore the **boundaries and techniques of innovation** using increasingly sophisticated **models and pipelines** applied to **fictional worlds**.

    The process I use is explained in **[How it Works](howitworks.md)** and you can start browsing the ideas themselves from the sidebar. For a deeper dive, explore my thinking about generative AI and product management more broadly on my other site : **[Creativity and Productivity](https://ashvin.au/creativity)**.
