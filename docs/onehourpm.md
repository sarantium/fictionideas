Goal : I want to build a collection of PM Agents that reduce the time taken to perform all end-toend PM tasks on any new product idea or feature or from being dropped in to any part of the PM process in 60 minutes. This specifically includes conducting all relevant data gathering via search or desktop research, all strategy all opportunity solution tree mapping all design ideas, lean canvas, building a low fidelity design, a prototype, a roadmap, a go-to-market plan

Goal: I want to make it commercially available via API in a site called onehourpm.com. THis is an offshoot of machineusers.com maybe??? Or maybe it's just part of it.

Goal : "Reduce PM task time to under 60 minutes for all stages of new products or features within 6 months".

Definition : Product management accelerates value creation and capture by changing and communicating choices
