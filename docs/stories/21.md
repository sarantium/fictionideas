## Hater's Corner

"Rattle's rides are just flashy death traps. Real raiders build their own wheels. Why rent when you can make something that's truly yours?"

## Main Competitor

"Desert Demons" - A rival gang offering more aggressive and heavily armed vehicles. They appeal to raiders who prefer brute force over strategy and reliability.

## Two-Sentence Story

During a showcase race, Rattle's favorite buggy, "The Scorpion," got stuck in a sand trap. He quipped, "Guess it's more of a desert snail today," as he cheerfully dug it out.

## Early Adopters

- **"Daring Dan"**: An adrenaline junkie seeking the thrill of high-speed desert chases.
- **"Clever Clara"**: A resourceful scout in need of reliable transportation for scouting missions.
- **"Scavenger Sam"**: A lone wolf who values stealth and efficiency on his looting expeditions.

## Maybe This Happens

Years down the line, Rattle finds himself teaching young wastelanders how to build their own raid rides, passing on his legacy and love for the open desert.
