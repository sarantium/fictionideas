## Story

In the vibrant trading city of Zephyria, renowned for its abundance of diamonds, renowned ring maker Elion faces a unique challenge. In this world of diverse non-human species, diamonds are as common as pebbles, and traditional diamond rings no longer captivate the market. Elion, with his venture LustraGem Artisans, revolutionizes the concept by infusing traditional craftsmanship with innovative, species-specific designs. He crafts rings that not only showcase the beauty of diamonds but also resonate with the unique cultural and anatomical characteristics of each species. From the elegant, spiraling rings for the tentacled Naiadians to the holographically enhanced bands for the light-sensitive Luxorians, LustraGem becomes a symbol of bespoke luxury and artistic expression.

## Founding Team

## Hater's Corner

"Sure, these fancy rings are nice to look at, but what's the point when diamonds are everywhere? It's just a shiny bauble at the end of the day. I prefer something more practical and less showy. Isn't the beauty of a ring in its simplicity and the meaning it holds, not in how many twists and turns it has?"

## Main Competitor

CrystalClasp Creations, a well-established jewelry maker, is LustraGem's main competitor. They focus on producing high-volume, standard designs that lack the customization and cultural depth of LustraGem's offerings. While popular for their affordability and traditional styles, CrystalClasp doesn't cater to the diverse needs of the non-human market as effectively as LustraGem.
