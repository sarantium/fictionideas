**Goal** : Given a context, create a simple goal.

## Code

```python

# imports
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import instructor
from openai import OpenAI
import os
from pathlib import Path
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, StringConstraints
from typing_extensions import Annotated

# load API key

dotenv_path = Path(r"C:\Storage\python_projects\ashvin\.env")
load_dotenv(dotenv_path=dotenv_path)
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# constants

GPT_MODEL = "gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09"

# instantiate client
client = instructor.patch(OpenAI())

# wrapper function

def wrapper(prompt: str, data: str | list, response_model:BaseModel | None = None):
    """Wrapper function to generate LLM completion"""
    return client.chat.completions.create(
        model=GPT_MODEL,
        response_model=response_model,
        max_retries=3,
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": prompt},
            {"role": "user", "content": data},
        ]
    )

# inputs
prompt = "Given a context, generate a goal"

context = # whatever you want to put here

# response class
class SimpleGoal(BaseModel):
    """Generate a concise and straightforward goal based on a specified action and target."""

    action: str = Field(..., description="The decisive action to be executed, using strong and directive verbs")
    target: str = Field(..., description="The specific item or resource on which the action is to be performed, described in simple language.")
    goal: Annotated[str, StringConstraints(max_length=50)] = Field(..., description="A concise, imperative sentence that combines the action and the target into a clear goal.")

# call the API
response = wrapper(prompt=prompt, data=context, response_model=SimpleGoal)

# print goal
print(response.goal)

```

## Examples

### Example 1

```python
context = """
I have lots of youtube podcasts I want to watch. But I don't have the time to do so.
Would be great if I can just put in a url or videoid and get back a summary with all the main points.
Saves me so much time.
"""
```

**Output**: 'Create a summary tool for YouTube podcasts'

### Example 2

```python
context = """
I like playing board games but don't have friends to play them with. Can't play with family as we always fight.
If I could just go somewhere to play games and find people to play with it would be great
"""
```

**Output**: 'Find a local board game club to join'

### Example 3

```python
context = """
We're expecting another baby soon, and my wife and I are starting to look into childcare options.
We want to make sure we get ourselves early on the waiting list.
I've heard horror stories that it can take over a year to get in to the popular ones.
"""
```

**Output**: 'Register at popular childcare providers early.'

### Example 4

```python
context = """
I want to read color comic books but I don't like the bright lights on tablets and phones.
It has to be portable and not strain my eyes.
"""
```

**Output**: 'Find a suitable e-reader for color comics'
