![How It Works](assets/how_it_works_2.png)

Everyday creativity is a numbers game in which **the more ideas we generate the more good ideas we'll have**. This happens often in daily activities - like trying new recipes with leftovers, making handmade gifts, or rearranging a desk for better utility.

Even though these innovations are understated, happening in the privacy of our homes and personal spaces, they are not routine. Improvised solutions like these are clear expressions of ingenuity that make our lives better in small but meaningful ways.

## What we know

Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are very good at generating ideas for everyday business situations. These ideas aren't just copied from what they've been taught; they combine elements to create new solutions faster - and often better - than humans.

### Speed

LMMs are unimaginably faster than humans at coming up with ideas. Research estimates of velocity range from 800 ideas generated per hour<sup>[1](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4526071)</sup> for short sentence outputs to 132 ideas generated per hour<sup>[2](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4533642)</sup> for short paragraph outputs.

Humans cannot match this pace. We need breaks, can experience creative blocks, and have a limited capacity for continuous creative output.

As the output format gets longer (page, document) or more multimodal (image, audio, video), the disparity between human and machine performance gets exponentially larger.

### Cost

LMMs also make idea generation cheaper. Across 730 ideas generated as short text paragraphs, the average API cost per idea was estimated at $0.037 and the average time to generate each idea was estimated at 27.2 seconds<sup>[3](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4533642)</sup>.

Extrapolating linearly leads to the table below:

| Number of Ideas | Time Required | Cost ($)  |
| --------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| 1               | 27.2 seconds  | 0.037     |
| 10              | 4.5 minutes   | 0.37      |
| 100             | 45.3 minutes  | 3.70      |
| 1,000           | 7.6 hours     | 37.00     |
| 10,000          | 3.1 days      | 370.00    |
| 100,000         | 31.5 days     | 3,700.00  |
| 1,000,000       | 314.8 days    | 37,000.00 |

Visualising this in a chart we see that LMMs can generate 1000 ideas in a single working day for a cost of $37, and 10,000 ideas in just over three days for a cost of $370.

![Chart 1](assets/how_it_works_4.png)

We also see that at the top end LMMs can generate 100,000 ideas in about a month for $3,700 and 1,000,000 ideas in less than a year for $37,000.

AI is more affordable whether we need a few ideas or thousands. Paying comparatively higher labour costs - annual staff salaries, hourly rates for contractors and consultants, or additional team infrastructure at scale - make human-driven idea generation inherently more expensive.

At the extreme, producing a million creative ideas is impossible even for large, well-funded human teams of experts, a barrier AI can now overcome.

??? danger "Caution"

    There are many limits to the back-of-the-envelope calculations above which completely ignore additional implementation costs, savings and complexities (devops costs, capital expenditure, API limits, parallel processing, externalities, subsidised usage) of using AI to generate ideas.

    We are also so early in the space that only a few studies are documenting this specific information, making it unclear how reliable and replicable these cost structures would be within a larger experiment sample size.

    **TL;DR take everything presented around costs with a healthy dose of skepticism.**

### Quality

> “Based on the research, not only are the latest forms of AI generating large numbers of ideas (fluency) and different types, variations, and categories of ideas (flexibility), they are, for the first time, generating new, unique, and unexpected ideas (originality), performing in the top percentile for original thinking.<sup>[4](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yjoc.2023.100065)</sup>"

Most people believe that even if AI is creative, it isn't as good as humans. Things are changing, especially for everyday business and product ideas.

GPT-4:

- outperforms 91% of human participants on the Alternative Uses Test that requires the generation of multiple original uses for five everyday objects (pants, ball, tire, fork, toothbrush).
- matches or exceeds 99% of human participants in originality on the Torrance Tests of creative thinking.
- dominates measures of purchase intent with 35 of the top 40 ideas from a pool of 400 as determined by human evaluators

For a long time, the kryptonite of AI is that it is not creative, or even where it is, it is not as creative as humans. This hypothesis is starting to be challenged. It does not matter if AI is faster and cheaper at generating ideas if those ideas don't meet some threshold standard of creativity.

Despite skepticisim about the limits of AI on

how creative AI really is, or how much originality is involved,

hallucination is creativity.

a specific kind of everyday creativity : mass idea generation that combines

The book _Art & Fear_ relates a pottery anecdote that perfectly describes this sentiment:

??? example "Quantity and quality"

    _The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality.

    His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the "quantity" group: fifty pounds of pots rated an "A", forty pounds a "B", and so on. Those being graded on "quality", however, needed to produce only one pot — albeit a perfect one — to get an "A".

    Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity.

    It seems that while the "quantity" group was busily churning out piles of work — and learning from their mistakes — the "quality" group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay._

The best way to have good ideas is to have lots of ideas.

1. Hallucination is creativity.
   a. This fact alone signals that generative AI can express novel ideas.
   b. Intended creativity is some

Creativity is the expression of novelty in some way.

??? example "Principles for Creativity"

    1. Create more ideas to make your ideas more creative
    2. Use other people's tools until you can't
    3. Try interesting things

## Step 1 : Prompts

Prompts are at the heart of LLM creativity. With trial and error, I created the following sequence of prompts that consistently generates a variety of imaginary businesses and products.

- Prompt 1 : Trisociation Prompt
- Prompt 2 : Character Generation Prompt
- Prompt 3 : Business/Product Idea-on-a-Page Prompt
- Prompt 4 : Product Image Prompt
- Optional Prompt 5 : Music Prompt ([Aqua Tents](10.md))
- Optional Prompt 6 : Animation Prompt [Whispering Gardens](12.md)

I started content creation by writing one prompt, entering it into ChatGPT 4 and almost immediately feeling embarrassed about how far the output fell short of the vision I had built in my head. Iterating on the prompt manually, and asking ChatGPT to refine the prompt, slowly got it to a state I was more comfortable with. In the end, after about 10 days of playing around with different words and formats, I managed to get a more or less consistently interesting idea on a page.

The end result after about 10 hours (about an hour a day) of just trying different things was three consecutive, dependent prompts as follows :

- Prompt 1 : Character Generation Prompt
- Prompt 2 : Business/Product Idea-on-a-Page Prompt
- Prompt 3 : Product Image Prompt

Ideas 1 - 9 ([GlimmerCraft](1.md) to [Cosmos Canvas](9.md)) were generated in this way. With idea 10 ([Aqua Tents](10.md)), I decided to add music by taking 2 relevant sentences from the description and using [Suno AI](https://www.suno.ai/) to generate a marketing jingle.

With Idea 11 ([Haiku Harmonics](11.md)]), I tested the [trisociation]() technique of random word triplets as a way to stretch the creative boundaries of the ideas being generated. This worked really well as the first prompt in the sequence, leading to far more varied, concrete and niche ideas. So, now the prompt structure is as follows:

- Prompt 1 : Character Generation Prompt
- Prompt 2 : Character Generation Prompt
- Prompt 3 : Business/Product Idea-on-a-Page Prompt
- Prompt 4 : Product Image Prompt
- Prompt 5 : Music Prompt

Finally, I added animation using [Leonardo](https://leonardo.ai/) for idea 12 ([Whispering Gardens](12.md)) to take in the image generated by the Product Image Prompt and converting it into an animation. I also experimented with generating the product image directly in [Leonardo](https://leonardo.ai/) instead of DALL-E.

- Prompt 6 : Animation Prompt

A full story with all 6 prompts can comfortably be created and published in 30 minutes just by manually copying and pasting them from my dev environment to the different tools. Since I had a paid subscription to ChatGPT, I did two timed speedruns of 5 ideas each for prompts 1 to 4.

> _Fiction can show you a different world. It can take you somewhere you've never been. Once you've visited other worlds, like those who ate fairy fruit, you can never be entirely content with the world that you grew up in. Discontent is a good thing: discontented people can modify and improve their worlds, leave them better, leave them different_ ---- **Neil Gaiman**

## Manual Prompts

For interfaces that help with productivity and for a broader engagement with AI in product management see my other site [Kiln](https://ashvin.au)

## Steps 1-2

- Step 1 : Manual prompts in chat gpt for idea then story. Initially just story. Then I added idea. Then Dall-E. Then timed. Then with random words or things that catch my attention.
- Step 2 : Manual prompts added to Suno AI and Leonardo AI for adding music and motion. also learnt about negative prompts.
- Step 3 : Trisociation of prompts, negative prompts, few shot examples.
- End result was timed manual pipeline to get a story in under 10 minutes

=> got it to under 13 mins on 12/01 just text and image

- trisociation really helps gives a more concrete feel to it.

## Steps 3

- Step 3 : Open AI pipeline via API in Jupyter Notebook Manually
- Step 4 : Add some basic RAG via llamaindex

## Steps 4

- add some features like synthetic users, wardley maps, lean canvas etc.
- Add agent based simulation models
- when do I add a streamlit app
- when do I add negative prompts
- when do I add an opensource model
- when do I add alternatives?
- when do I finetune a model?
