![How It Works](assets/howitworks_1.png)

> _Fiction can show you a different world. It can take you somewhere you've never been. Once you've visited other worlds, like those who ate fairy fruit, you can never be entirely content with the world that you grew up in. Discontent is a good thing: discontented people can modify and improve their worlds, leave them better, leave them different_ ---- **Neil Gaiman**

## Manual Prompts

For interfaces that help with productivity and for a broader engagement with AI in product management see my other site [Kiln](https://ashvin.au)

## Steps 1-2

- Step 1 : Manual prompts in chat gpt for idea then story. Initially just story. Then I added idea. Then Dall-E. Then timed. Then with random words or things that catch my attention.
- Step 2 : Manual prompts added to Suno AI and Leonardo AI for adding music and motion. also learnt about negative prompts.
- End result was timed manual pipeline to get a story in under 10 minutes

## Steps 3

- Step 3 : Open AI pipeline via API in Jupyter Notebook Manually
- Step 4 : Add some basic RAG via llamaindex

## Steps 4

- add some features like synthetic users, wardley maps, lean canvas etc.
- Add agent based simulation models
- when do I add a streamlit app
- when do I add negative prompts
- when do I add an opensource model
- when do I add alternatives?
- when do I finetune a model?
