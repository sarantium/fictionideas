    A dedicated platform team accelerates AI value creation and capture for B2B SaaS companies

Innovations are adopted quickly if they are easy to make, easy to use, fit existing patterns, and have visible results. Generative AI has abruptly changed the innovation landscape by acclerating the utility and availability of AI products and services.

While the vast majority of consumers and companies do not make technology, they are actively searching for value in this space. Consequently, technology companies are trying to implement AI features that create value for their customers as fast as possible.

The long tail of B2B SaaS companies have a unique set of challenges. They have enterprise client traction and skilled development teams but lack extra capital and in-house AI/ML resources, making it hard to bootstrap production grade AI capabilities and features.

## Goals

A dedicated platform team helps B2B SaaS companies stay competitive by quickly matching competitors' advances and meeting client expectations for new experiences.

This team drives innovation, positioning the company as a leader in AI, and reduces risk by providing systemic infrastructure and resources to prevent project failures.

It specifically helps:

1. Product teams launch AI features
2. Business teams automate workflows
3. Leaders unify AI strategy, standards and voice
4. Clients adopt third-party AI products
5. Staff upskill AI knowledge and skills

Ultimately, platform teams shape organisational culture, ensuring that responsibility and enthusiasm for AI are shared by everyone, not just a small group of evangelists.

Good platform teams function as skunkworks, rapid execution engines, and guardrails, ensuring the company quickly and safely integrates AI across all operations in order to benefit clients and establish AI leadership amongst competitors.

## Ideas

When bootstrapping platform teams, only speed and outcomes matter. Fast, cheap value creation determines whether platforms continue or are killed off because resources are limited, track records nonexistent and executive patience is thin.

Platform teams must act for all functions and departments in a B2B SaaS company. They should tackle cross disciplinary needs - at least product, design and engineering to start with - and champion fairness - equitable platform access to all products - as foundational principles for success.

Focusing on both technical tooling and service delivery is important, as the latter reduces early bottlenecks the most.

In this environment, prioritisation is king and selecting the correct set of valuable and feasible initiatives to iterate on and build company confidence is crucial.

- probabilistic software infrastructure

## Josh's Ideas

- What would be timeline for a new feature. What would a sprint look like? What is the capacity of the team
- Some govt and justice product needs an AI feature
- do advanced AI stuff without needing a yearlong project
- What would you need to do to enable a team to enable the most simple thing like a summarisation feature => do we need an experimentation capability
- automatic evaluation
- what models to use
- what metrics to have
- observability platform
- take Admissions approach and generalise it
- How would you take it and generalise it ?

  - data sovereignty - map n data privacy issues
  - techniques for passing secure endpoints. clear understanding of what goes where. privacy guarantees
  - if you had a understanding of privacy constraints you could map that - technical infrastructure and techniques
  - tools and assistance on working with synthetic data how to make sure it is reliable and some tooling
  - centralising tooling is a difficult problem to solve
  - advanced techniques available to a product regardless of expertise
  - really good framework to reduce the costs of LLMs => can document that, write up actual code
  - benefit of centralising AI expertise

  - An over all evaluation rubric
  - making it more suited to a regular machine learning workflow

## Trends

As platform teams mature, the following are a list of key trends to keep in mind.

- Dramatic cost reductions are expected along with increased capital allocation as an ongoing part of budgets (e.g. OpenAI costs reduction)
- Generational change in user behaviour as it comes to agentic/avataric applications
- New revenue streams from AI products
- Boring, high value use cases in automation will proliferate

Dead internet theory says that internet is just bots. Gen AI can accelerate this. Full of stochastic content of no value. And further full of scams. The idea that search will keep up is laughable.

## Thoughts

- focus on how to implement in organisations
- B2B > B2C
- deep dive into edtech
- deep dive into workflows?
- involve wardley maps.
- I like SamboNova

## Various things

- Avatars vs agents. Avatars create connections and are an investment, building a moat which induces switching costs that are not felt by impersonal transactional agents. I.e. an Avatar assistant is less replacable than an agent assistant

A **machine user** is an AI or software entity that performs tasks within digital environments or interacts with humans. These entities can range from simple automated programs to complex systems capable of emulating human decision-making and interaction.

Machine users are pivotal in today's digital landscape, serving a multitude of purposes across various industries. Their abilities span from executing repetitive tasks to engaging in dynamic, human-like interactions. Understanding the distinct types of machine users helps in harnessing their capabilities for improved efficiency, engagement, and innovation.

The classification is based on:

- **Decision Complexity**: Reflects the machine user's capability for making decisions, ranging from basic algorithm-driven choices to advanced, context-aware problem-solving.
- **Relational Dynamics**: Represents the level of interaction the machine user has with its environment or with humans, from simple responses to complex, engaging conversations.

### Quadrants

**Quadrant I: Twins**

These are advanced simulations of real-world systems or processes that can make complex decisions and interact dynamically with their environment.

- _Healthcare Digital Twin_: Adapts treatment plans based on real-time health data.
- _Smart City Digital Twin_: Manages urban environments by integrating diverse data sources.

**Quadrant II: Avatars**

Digital representations that interact with users or environments in a meaningful way but are limited in decision-making complexity.

- _Virtual Customer Service Representative_: Guides customers through online retail stores.
- _Educational Virtual Tutor_: Assists students on e-learning platforms.

**Quadrant III: Bots**

Software programs designed to perform automated tasks, usually repetitive and with minimal interaction.

- _Chatbot for Hotel Bookings_: Manages room bookings and customer queries.
- _Social Media Content Moderator Bot_: Flags inappropriate content based on set guidelines.

**Quadrant IV: Agents**

These systems perform complex tasks autonomously but with limited interaction, focusing on efficiency and execution.

- _Algorithmic Trading Agent_: Executes stock trades based on market analysis.
- _Autonomous Industrial Robot_: Performs complex tasks in manufacturing with minimal human interaction.

### Classification

In this section, we dive deeper into a few complex machine user examples to clarify their categorization:

- **Autonomous Negotiating Car**: A self-driving car that negotiates with smart parking lots for space would be classified as a **Twin**, due to its high decision complexity in real-time and its high relational dynamics in engaging with the parking infrastructure.

- **Self-Restocking Fridge**: A refrigerator that monitors inventory and orders groceries when supplies run low would fall under **Agents**. While it autonomously manages its inventory (high decision complexity), its interactions are limited to transactional ordering processes (low relational dynamics).

- **AI Legal Advisor**: An AI that provides legal advice by analyzing case law and statutes would be an **Agent**. It requires a high level of decision complexity to interpret and apply legal principles but generally does not engage in complex interactions as its advice is typically delivered in a report format.

- **Interactive Fictional Character**: In an immersive storytelling platform, this AI character interacts with users, making choices that influence the story. Its decision-making might appear complex, but it's primarily designed to emulate a character within a narrative context, categorizing it as an avatar.

Understanding the capabilities and interactions of machine users is critical for businesses and developers as they integrate AI into their operations and products. This classification helps in strategizing the deployment of AI systems for optimal performance and user experience.

#### Misclassification

For a machine user to be classified as an **Avatar**, it must exhibit both role emulation and interactivity. Role emulation involves the machine user mimicking or representing a human role, behavior, or persona, often in a digital or virtual environment. Interactivity refers to the machine user's capability to engage in dynamic, two-way interactions, often resembling human-like conversations or social behaviors.

- **Automated News Reader**: Imagine an AI that reads out news articles in a human-like voice. While it might seem like an avatar due to its human-like speech (role emulation), it lacks interactive capabilities. The AI does not engage in two-way communication; it simply performs a one-way broadcast of information. This absence of interactivity classifies it more accurately as a **Bot**, as it's primarily executing a defined, repetitive task without the dynamic engagement typical of avatars.

- **Virtual Museum Guide**: Consider an AI that provides guided tours in a virtual museum. If this AI simply follows a predetermined path and script without engaging with visitors' questions or personalizing the tour based on visitor interactions, it would be an **Agent** rather than an Avatar. Despite emulating the role of a tour guide (role emulation), the lack of real-time, responsive interaction with visitors means it doesn't fully meet the criteria for an Avatar.

Even when a process utilises advanced technologies like Large Language Models (LLMs), it can still be classified as a **Bot**. This classification hinges on the task's nature and the level of decision complexity and interactivity, rather than the sophistication of the technology used.

- **Task Specificity**: If the primary role is executing predefined, often repetitive tasks such as data generation or answering standard queries, it aligns with the bot's characteristic functionality.
- **Limited Interactivity**: Bots typically exhibit restricted interactive capabilities. A process using LLMs but not engaging in dynamic, responsive dialogues fits this category.

- **Decision Scope**: The use of LLMs does not automatically imply complex decision-making. If decisions are based on set rules or parameters, despite the advanced nature of the technology, the process is akin to a bot's operation.

**Example**: An LLM-driven chatbot for customer service, offering scripted responses to inquiries, demonstrates this concept. Despite its advanced underlying technology, its role in providing specific information without complex interactions or autonomous decision-making categorizes it as a "Bot."

In essence, the application and function of the technology, rather than its inherent complexity, determine a machine user's classification.

If agents can help product managers architect and orchestrate workflows that result in faster, cheaper and better quality outcomes, then, depending on the scale of the improvement different opportunities open up.

- slight improvements lead to more productive PMs
- large improvements lead to changes in PM skillsets and labour force compositions (the jury is still out) and the move from "No" to "Yes" (https://x.com/clairevo/status/1774451083622191400?s=20)
- enormous improvements lead to a reshaping of the technology and productivity landscape with the rise of machine users
