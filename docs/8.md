## Hater's Corner

"I tried 'Galactic Questers' and sure, the views were great, but the risks? They don't tell you about dodging rogue comets or negotiating with temperamental space merchants. It's not for the faint-hearted, or those who prefer their feet on solid ground."

## Main Competitor

"Starborne Sagas," a rival company, offers virtual reality space adventures. While safer and more accessible, their simulated experiences lack the authenticity and adrenaline of real space travel, making "Galactic Questers" the choice for true adventure seekers.

## Two-Sentence Story

During a quest, Captain Nova accidentally activated an ancient alien device, causing her crew to speak in rhymes for 24 hours. It turned out to be the most poetic treasure hunt in the galaxy!
