## Sixth Pass Notes

**Current Landscape**

1.  AI narrows the gap between ideas and execution.
    a. It lowers skill requirements and barriers to entry, and promises value creation that is faster, cheaper and better.
    b. This will impact labour and capital allocation in SMBs, large enterprises and technology vendors.
    c. While value creation is accelerating, it remains unclear which layer of the stack will benefit the most from value capture.

!!! tip "Hypothesis 1"

    Over 50% of value capture will reside in the generative AI **application layer**

2.  The current AI landscape can be split into B2C and B2B segments, tackling different challenges.

| **Segments**       | **B2C**                               | **B2B**                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Value**          | Personalised, multimodal interactions | Reduces time and costs through workflow automation   |
| **Metaphors**      | Products as dynamic conversations     | Digital assembly line: tireless and highly efficient |
| **Opportunity**    | Instant, adaptive consumer interfaces | Domain specialised vertical solutions                |
| **Solution Focus** | User experience                       | Operational efficiency                               |

B2B2C applications should follow the money, improving client automation before consumer experience because automation usually has a more direct impact on revenue and cost.

3. The following workflow patterns and timescales are emerging as trends in the market:

| No. | Timescale | Trend                        | Description                                                                  |
| --- | --------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Now       | Speeding up user journeys    | Enhances efficiency of operations                                            |
| 2   | Now       | Expanding user journey reach | End-to-end vertical solutions for niche domains                              |
| 3   | Next      | Deep multi-step workflows    | Transforms siloed, light tasks to comprehensive solutions                    |
| 4   | Next      | Proactive automation         | Anticipates and automates needs and new workflows                            |
| 5   | Next      | Voice-first interactions     | Improves accessibility and simplifies user interface                         |
| 6   | Later     | AI-native solutions          | Integrates seamless, multimodal experiences in consumer and business domains |
| 7   | Later     | Autonomy                     | Enables operations without human intervention                                |
| 8   | Later     | Personalised interfaces      | Adapts workflows to individual user preferences, improving user experience   |
| 9   | Later     | Agent economies              | Creates networks of interacting, automated agents                            |

4. Edtech Categories

- Education management is a small category in today's edtech AI landscape, with learning and student experience innovation dominating market maps.
- TAM for AI in edtech is expected to gu up? (a16z)
- https://www.reachcapital.com/2023/09/11/pipeline-perspectives-trends-from-280-generative-ai-edtech-tools/

!!! tip "Hypothesis 2"

    The potential for value capture in education management automation is inversely proportional to its current value creation size in the edteech landscape

4. Challenges

- Uncertainty
  - Can value be derived from non-deterministic outputs? Can hallucinations resolved? I think so.
  - What pricing models are going to work here : maybe a shift from monthly flat fee to usage based?
  - what does it mean that to advance we need to stay ahead of the regulatory curve
