## Fourth Pass Notes

- Current Landscape
  - AI narrows the gap between ideas and execution
  - It lowers skill requirements and barriers to entry
  - The promise is of value creation and capture that is cheaper, faster and better
  - Will have an impact on labour and capital allocation in SMBs and enterprise, as well as in technology vendors
  - While value creation is emerging and accelerating it is very unclear how value capture will play out and which layer of the stack will seize it.
- Customer Segments
  - B2C : Transforming the user experience through personalised, multimodal experiences
  - B2B : Reducing time and cost through workflow automation
- Metaphors
  - B2C: products become conversations
  - B2B: a digital assembly line that’s both tireless and exponentially efficient.
- B2B Workflow Patterns
  - Speeding up existing user journeys.
  - Expanding the reach and completeness of user journeys.
  - Developing niche applications with vertical integration.
  - Transitioning from light, single-task workflows to deep, multi-step workflows.
- Emerging Trends in AI
  - Redefining Experiences: Both consumer and business domains are seeing a shift towards AI-first and AI-native solutions that offer fully integrated, multimodal experiences.
  - Voice-First Interactions: Emerging as a key user interface, enhancing accessibility and ease of use.
  - Autonomy: The move towards human-out-of-the-loop configurations where AI systems operate independently.
  - Agent Economies: Environments where AI agents not only support human activities but also interact among themselves, creating a dynamic network of automated agents.
  - Every human is a manager of agents?
  - Proactive Automation: AI's ability to anticipate the need for new components or entirely new workflows, and to automate them effectively.
  - Personalized Automation Interfaces: Tailoring the automation's user interface to individual user needs, ensuring that the workflow adapts to the user rather than vice versa.
- Uncertainty
  - Can value be derived from non-deterministic outputs? Can hallucinations resolved? I think so.
  - What pricing models are going to work here : maybe a shift from monthly flat fee to usage based?
  - what does it mean that to advance we need to stay ahead of the regulatory curve
- Edtech
  - What is the edtech landscape doing or saying?
- Advantages over traditional workflows :
  - **Efficiency and Autonomy**: AI streamlines processes in real time and autonomously initiates workflows, reducing the need for manual oversight and freeing up staff for strategic roles.
  - **Decision-Making and Personalization**: AI enhances decision-making by processing complex data and customizes workflows to individual preferences, boosting both accuracy and user engagement.
  - **Proactivity and System Integration**: AI proactively addresses potential disruptions and ensures seamless data integration across systems, maintaining operational continuity and coherence.
  - **Regulatory Adaptation**: AI continuously adapts to evolving regulatory standards, safeguarding data usage and user privacy.

## Third Pass Notes

- AI narrows the gap between ideas and execution, and lowers skill requirements and barriers to entry
- We are at an inflection point in which consumer value creation for user is clear and business value creation for user is emerging; in both cases everyone is figuring out value capture
- Segmentation:
  - B2C is focused on interaction to transform the user experience
  - B2B is focused on automation to speed up processing
- B2B automation trends let us own the entire workflow without breaking the user experience.
  - makes existing user journeys faster
  - extends reach and completeness of a user journey
  - niche apps that are vertically integrated
  - move beyond
  - light workflows of single tasks to deep workflows of multi step tasks
  - Wave 1 of 1:many (i.e. create multiple outputs from one input such as generating emails etc.) to Wave 2 of many:1 (condensing all info into a decision point or outcome like same day enrolment or course admittance decisions)
- Emerging are:
  - redefined experiences in both consumer and business around multimodal, AI-first and AI-native
  - Voice first interactions
  - human-out-of-the-loop
  - agent economies in in which
    - agent teams augment individuals and businesses both at consumer and professional settings
    - agents interact with one another without humans as intermediaries
  - proactively predicting new components of existing workflows or new workflows to automate
  - personalising the UI of the automation - i.e. work moulds to you not you mould to the work.
- Readytech is B2B2C
- the need is for a workflow factory in which workflows can be defined and executed by customers?

## Second Pass Notes

- AI narrows the gap between ideas and execution.
- Some axes to split innovation/value : B2C vs B2B
- The edge offered by AI is
  - make existing user journeys faster with automation
  - extend reach and completeness of a user journey beyond the original via vertical and horizontal integration in which user-flow is not broken
  - redefine the experience with multimodal combinations via AI-first and AI-native experiences
- Opportunities are highest when considering
  - High information volume
  - High signal to noise
- For B2B Wave 1 is about 1:Many (expanding one thing into other things) and Wave 2 is many:1 (reducing from many things into 1 thing)
- niche apps moulded to the entire user need/journey are emerging. 1 app to rule them all not fragmentedly working and linking many apps.
- difference between wanting an assistant/companion experience versus wanting the end outcome/artifact etc.
- emerging are:
  - human-out-of-the-loop with fuly autonomous agents
  - machine users interacting with other machine users
  - individuals essentially having agent teams to help them.
  - Wave 1 was about a 1:many flow around creating/generating content e.g. emails, asking questions etc.
- Wave 2 is about a many to 1 around taking lots of inputs and condensing them to drive insight and decision making and action
- key trends here are about owning the workflow and automation to leverage time
- emerging future here is predicting the action or automation needed and executing them. Proactive and anticapatory automation.
- emergin future is also identifying automation potential and new workflow opportunities not thought through by humans
- Idea [My own] : human in the loop seems a crutch in many situations accounting for the immaturity of current technology rather than a desired end state.
- no need for human intermediary in future
- emerging opportunity around voice

## First Pass Notes

### General Notes

- we are automating the journey
- We are expanding the edges of the journey
- We are / are not considering the redefining the journey
- the b2b article has a signla to noise and information volume quadrant

### Item 1 : Consumer Abundance Agenda

- Category : AI accelerates the transition from imagination to creation by narrowing the gap between idea and execution. This includes content generation and remixing., including new processes and outputs such as in-painting. The barrier to begin is dramatically lowered for all.
- Category : AI goes beyond organising tasks to helping complete them with real-time assistance. This also lowers the barriers to entry to build own workflows.
- Idea [My Own] : Build a Bear Workshop analogy. A workflow factory.
- In both content and productivity, the idea of multimodal inputs and outputs comes across with voice apps particularly referenced.
- Category : Companionship is the version of AI which interacts largely 1:1 where the AI substitutes its assumed character for humans - an avatar. The advantage here is niche cases versus generalist apps. It is about new UI/UX patterns. And it is about memory and progression of interaction over time.
- Category : Social agents. THis is where AI goes beyond 1:1 and interact 1:many as social actors in networks. Starting with influencer/content creation but eventually acting as a sort of concierge or personal assistant. Again the theme of multimodal inputs and outputs.
- Idea [My Own] : My quadrant diagram.
- Category : My wording is a sort of concierge, bespoke family office, or team of personal assistants. Particularly in specific domains such as Finance and Wellness.
- Category : Education. The future is again multimodal, learning that is experiential and looks very different UI/UX, hyper specialised niches. Interestingly the distribution channels will remain institutional at least in the beginning.

### Item 2 : AI Agent Infrastructure

- Category : Handcrafted and specialised agents are present, helping to resolve deterministic tasks and plans. Dynamic agents are a way off.
- There is a list of Infrastructure providers and emerging infrastructure primitives emerging in this space
- Idea [My Own]: call this an emerging technologies memo over market intelligence?

### Item 3 : Market Map of productivity tools

- reinforces the in-context automation and not breaking the user flow/experience by switching apps.

### Item 4 : B2B AI Apps

- Wave 1 was about a 1:many flow around creating/generating content e.g. emails, asking questions etc.
- Wave 2 is about a many to 1 around taking lots of inputs and condensing them to drive insight and decision making and action
- key trends here are about owning the workflow and automation to leverage time
- emerging future here is predicting the action or automation needed and executing them. Proactive and anticapatory automation.
- emergin future is also identifying automation potential and new workflow opportunities not thought through by humans
- Idea [My own] : human in the loop seems a crutch in many situations accounting for the immaturity of current technology rather than a desired end state.

### Item 5 : AI Voice Agents

- Category : Voice in B2B replacing human calling in areas like sales and support
- Opportunity : There is a specific opportunity to provide expert services such as therapy or coaching or companionship without needing a human intermediary
- Idea [My Own] : Voice is still searching for its aha moment to change user behaviour with the B2C change a bit harder as it is voluntary over B2B
- Idea [My Own] : There is a readytech opportunity in edtech to provide voice for our clients
- human intervantion for complex scenarios - I.E level 3 intervention/support
- Technical Challenge/Opportunity around improving latency
- Specific callouts on Voice and Edtech

### Item 6 : Prosumer Workflows

- Opportunity : for genAI-first and genAI native workflows
- Category : Light (single task) versus deep (multi-step) workflows
- Category : Professional versus artistic
- Helps solve the blank page problem
- multimodal is highlighted again

### Item 7 : Top 100 Consumer Gen AI Apps

- Mobile Edtech is the second largest category on mobile

### Item 8 : Future of Edtech

- Opportunity : Individualised learning and support will be realised
- Trend : Rise of AI-first or AI-native apps
- Challenge : Assessment and Credentialling will have to adapt

### Item 9 : Gen AI Education

- Category : detailed mapping of education areas for GenAI. Teacher practice, classroom material, evaluation and feedback, student support. various subcategories.

### Item 10 : AI Marketing Automation

- Opportunity : Semi-autonomous management of entire campaigns and workflows
- Opportunity : Content creation and editing
- Opportunity : Hyperpersonalisation that can be tracked with metrics
- Trends : Convergence of marketing and sales
- Trends : converting assets from one form/channel to another making them more productive assets

### Item 11 : AI Productivity for SMBs

### Item 12 : AI Legal Map

- AI streamlines discovery, search, extraction and review
- claim is it can handle 90% of the contract process

### Item 13 : Cretive Content

### Item 14 : Agent Design Pattern

### Item 15 : Education Market Map

### Item 16 : AI Companionship

- wide utility from entertainment to service
- SFW and NSFW
- e.g. Mental Health bots, learning tutors etc.

### Summary

### Detailed Notes on AI-Enhanced Productivity Tools

#### Overview

Productivity tools have historically appealed to hyper-enthusiasts due to their complexity and manual execution requirements. AI advancements are transforming this space by automating actions, potentially turning to-do lists into proactive assistants. Tools in this domain can be categorized into four key themes:

#### 1. Systems of Action (Agents)

- **General Agents**: Capable of completing common tasks across various domains.
- **Vertical Agents**: Specialized for specific, complex tasks.
- **Example**: An AI that manages an entire workflow from start to finish.

#### 2. Voice-First Products

- **Natural Communication**: Voice as a medium allows for more natural interaction, enabling users to ramble and engage in back-and-forth exchanges.
- **Future Expectations**: Advanced versions of voice assistants like Siri that range from simple dictation to complex ambient audio analysis.

#### 3. In-Flow Assistance

- **Context Switching**: Minimizing disruptions by integrating AI into existing workflows.
- **Applications**: All-in-one products or copilot features in browsers and email clients that enhance productivity without breaking the user's flow.

#### 4. "Build Your Own" Workflows

- **Non-Programmer Friendly**: Tools enabling non-programmers to create custom automations.
- **Current State**: Requires significant manual input for complex tasks.
- **Future Vision**: Seamless prompt-to-full-workflow automation.

These themes highlight the transformative potential of AI in making productivity tools more accessible, efficient, and capable of handling a broader range of tasks with minimal user intervention.

### Lecture Notes: AI-Based Software in Marketing and Sales

#### Introduction

- The integration of AI in marketing and sales is revolutionizing traditional methods, bringing efficiency, personalization, and automation to the forefront.
- Generative AI (Gen AI) is playing a crucial role in this transformation by enabling advanced data-driven decision-making and automating repetitive tasks.

#### Key Concepts and Ideas

1. **End-to-End Marketing Tasks**

   - AI agents are now capable of completing end-to-end marketing tasks such as A/B testing, optimizing ad bidding, tracking attribution, and iterating content based on performance.
   - These agents integrate with performance data (e.g., CTRs) and content creation tools, using their judgment to experiment with new variations of content to drive results.
   - Example: Email marketing agents can generate and personalize content, set send schedules, monitor open rates, and adjust content based on performance metrics.

2. **Automation of Marketing Processes**

   - AI agents can autonomously manage campaigns, supplementing individual roles and allowing marketers to focus on strategic initiatives.
   - Marketers can run more frequent experiments with the help of AI, which can suggest and implement changes, then analyze the results.

3. **Challenges and Risks**

   - Gen AI can produce confident-sounding outputs that are not grounded in facts, leading to risks such as "hallucinations," biases, data privacy violations, and copyright infringement.
   - High-stakes decision-making, regulated environments, and applications involving a high volume of requests or numerical reasoning are areas where Gen AI is typically less suited.

4. **Customized Gen AI Solutions**

   - Companies are developing unique, customized solutions by adapting off-the-shelf models and training them on smaller, task-specific data sets.
   - This approach can lead to exponential improvements in campaign and product customization.
   - Example: A European telecommunications company used Gen AI to create hyperpersonalized messaging for 150 specific segments, resulting in a 40% lift in response rates and a 25% reduction in deployment costs.

5. **AI as a Full-Service Marketing Team**
   - The ultimate goal is for AI agents to take on the duties of a CMO and operate as an autonomous marketing team.
   - This includes running omnichannel strategies and managing everything from market research to brand campaigns.

#### Trends and Predictions

1. **Convergence of Marketing and Sales**

   - AI agents enable a one-to-one marketing approach, which may blur the lines between sales and marketing.
   - The challenge lies in solving attribution issues to ensure AI can make informed decisions.

2. **Vertical Integration**

   - AI marketing companies often start with a specific vertical (e.g., video or email) and evolve over time.
   - These companies will learn to optimize performance within their niche and eventually expand to other areas.

3. **Performance and Creative Optimization**
   - AI tools will optimize various aspects of marketing, from blog post headlines for SEO to video performance on social media platforms.
   - Existing assets can be leveraged to generate additional content types, enhancing the overall marketing strategy.

#### Opportunities

1. **Enhanced Personalization**

   - AI can tailor marketing messages to individual preferences and behaviors, increasing engagement and conversion rates.
   - Example: A beverage company used Gen AI to develop a new product concept for the EU market in a fraction of the time it would traditionally take.

2. **Cost Reduction**

   - Automation reduces the need for extensive human intervention, lowering deployment costs and improving efficiency.

3. **Scalability**

   - AI-driven marketing strategies can be scaled easily, handling vast amounts of data and interactions simultaneously.

4. **Data-Driven Insights**
   - Continuous learning and data integration allow AI agents to provide deeper insights and improve decision-making over time.

#### Questions and Issues

1. **Ethics and Governance**

   - How can companies ensure that AI-generated content adheres to ethical standards and avoids biases?
   - What governance structures should be in place to monitor AI's performance and mitigate risks?

2. **Integration with Existing Systems**

   - How can AI tools be seamlessly integrated with existing marketing platforms and workflows?
   - What are the best practices for training AI models with proprietary data?

3. **User Trust and Adoption**
   - How can marketers ensure that consumers trust and engage with AI-driven marketing efforts?
   - What measures can be taken to overcome negative perceptions of AI in marketing?

#### Conclusion

- The future of marketing and sales lies in the seamless integration of AI, which promises to enhance efficiency, personalization, and strategic decision-making.
- By addressing the challenges and leveraging the opportunities presented by Gen AI, companies can stay ahead in the competitive landscape and deliver exceptional value to their customers.

### Key Themes in Companion Products

   - Differentiation can be in UX or the model itself (e.g., lack of censorship in NSFW bots).

2. **New Modes of Interaction**

   - Future companion products are expected to be more dynamic and "live," incorporating voice, avatars, personality, and animation.
   - Examples: Moemate allows virtual assistants to interact in real-time in augmented reality settings.

3. **Memory and Progression**

   - Effective companion products should evolve over time, remembering past interactions and personalizing future ones.
   - Products like Replika demonstrate how AI can build deeper, more meaningful relationships over time.

4. **Human to Companion Interactions**

### Market Opportunities and Challenges
