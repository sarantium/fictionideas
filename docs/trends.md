## Market Value

AI narrows the gap between ideas and execution. It lowers skill requirements and barriers to entry, and promises value creation that is faster, cheaper and better. This will impact labour and capital allocation in SMBs, large enterprises and technology vendors.

While value creation is accelerating, it remains unclear which layer of the stack will benefit the most from value capture.

However, there is an emerging set of beliefs in the market that AI infrastructure (foundation models, inference, observability, etc.) is very capital intensive, rapidly being commoditised as a low-margin utility, and converging to an oligopoly. Outside the hyperscalers and early adopters, it is also seen as the precursor to the real value waiting to be unlocked in mature applications over the next decade.

    The bulk of the Total Addressable Market for generative AI will reside in the **application layer**

## Market Segment

The current AI landscape can be split into B2C and B2B segments, each tackling different challenges.

| Segments        | B2C                                   | B2B                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Value**       | Personalised, multimodal interactions | Reduces time and costs through workflow automation   |
| **Metaphors**   | Products as dynamic conversations     | Digital assembly line: tireless and highly efficient |
| **Opportunity** | Instant, adaptive consumer interfaces | Domain specialised vertical solutions                |
| **Focus**       | User experience                       | Operational efficiency                               |

B2B2C applications straddle both segments. Established products in this category should follow the money, prioritising efficiency over experience because automation benefits usually compound faster and have a more direct impact on revenue and cost.

## Emerging Opportunities

### Workflow Patterns

The following workflow patterns and timescales are emerging as trends in the market, with extremely compressed iteration cycles becoming the norm:

| No. | Timescale | Trend                        | Description                                                                  |

| 2   | Now       | Expanding user journey reach | End-to-end vertical solutions for niche domains                              |
| 3   | Next      | Deep multi-step workflows    | Transforms siloed, light tasks to comprehensive solutions                    |
| 4   | Next      | Proactive automation         | Anticipates and automates needs and new workflows                            |
| 5   | Next      | Voice-first interactions     | Improves accessibility and simplifies user interface                         |
| 6   | Later     | AI-native solutions          | Integrates seamless, multimodal experiences in consumer and business domains |
| 7   | Later     | Autonomy                     | Enables operations without human intervention                                |
| 8   | Later     | Personalised interfaces      | Adapts workflows to individual user preferences, improving user experience   |
| 9   | Later     | Agent economies              | Creates networks of interacting, automated agents                            |

## Education Management

Education management is a small category in today's edtech AI landscape, with learning and student experience innovation dominating market maps.

### Education Market Map 1

In a survey of 285 companies, only a negligible number fell in this area, with relatively minor investments to date.

### Legal Market Map

While the focus on automation has been limited - and therein lies the opportunity - looking at related and slightly more mature domains such as AI in legal tech demonstrate that all kinds of automation and workflow improvements dominate the sector :

[Source](https://www.battery.com/blog/the-new-code-of-law/)

![LAW MARKET MAP 1](assets/law_market_map_1.jpg)

The maturity of AI in legaltech space is clear especially when considering that even established players like [LexisNexis](https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/products/lexis-plus-ai.page) have advanced automation features in production already. IT Compliance is also an area of advanced, domain specific AI automation in which alot of opportunity is emerging: [6clicks](https://www.6clicks.com/)

### Edtech Opportunity

!!! tip "Hypothesis 3"

    The opportunity for automation related AI value creation and capture in edtech far outstrips its current footprint, with legal tech and IT compliance as reference models

## Competitors

- **[IN PROGRESS]**
  - smaller, local players like Accelerate, Wisenet
  - Medium domain competitors like Tribal, Techone
  - Larger global encroachers like Salesforce
  - international startups in the space?

## Workflow Engines

Building and maintaining workflow engines from scratch requires substantial time and labour costs, measured in years not months. This is a deal-breaker in any competitive market, compounded in the generative AI space where iteration speed is orders of magnitude faster than traditional software engineering.

### Workflow Automation Vendor Evaluation Criteria

Buying workflow automation tools, should start with the following set of evaluation criteria :

| No. | Criteria          | Definition                                                 |
