## One Hour PM

I'm building a library - a work in progress which I'm calling **One Hour PM** - that uses generative AI agents to help product managers accelerate value creation and capture. It does this by exploring how agents and automations can improve **creative** and **productive** ways of working with product ideas and tasks.

The library has the following key features:

- **Simple**: One input interface across all tasks
- **Multimodal**: Inputs and outputs work with many data types
- **Curated**: Modern product tools and templates selected with a bias for lean workflows
- **Contextual**: Add custom data sources for more specific and specialised outcomes
- **Connected**: Access to internal and external tools
- **Automatic**: Agents execute creative and directed tasks semi-autonomously
- **Fast**: Compressing task cycle times to minutes and workflow cycle times to an hour
- **Solo**: Get more done with only yourself-in-the-loop
- **Safe**: Validated output that enforces structure and reliability
